# Home Sales Analysis with SparkSQL

## Project Overview

This challenge involves utilizing SparkSQL to analyze home sales data and derive key metrics. The tasks include creating temporary views, partitioning data, caching and uncaching tables, and optimizing queries for performance evaluation.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Preparation and SparkSQL Queries
- **Home_Sales.ipynb:** Google Colab notebook for data analysis and SparkSQL queries.
  - Import necessary PySpark SQL functions.
  - Read and load the home sales data from `home_sales_revised.csv` into a Spark DataFrame.
  - Create a temporary table named `sales`.
  - Answer specific questions using SparkSQL queries:
    1. Average price for a four-bedroom house sold each year.
    2. Average price of homes based on year built, bedrooms, and bathrooms criteria.
    3. Average price of homes meeting specific criteria (bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and area).
    4. Average price of homes per "view" rating with a price threshold.

### Part 2: Data Caching and Performance Comparison
- Cache and uncache the `sales` temporary table.
- Measure query runtimes with and without caching.
- Partition data by the "date_built" field and create a temporary table for parquet data.
- Run optimized queries on cached and uncached data, comparing runtime performances.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **README.md:** Overview of the project, its structure, and usage instructions.
- **Home_Sales_Colab.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook (intended to run in Google Colab) containing PySpark code for data analysis and SparkSQL queries.
- **.gitignore:** File to exclude sensitive files and folders from version control.

## Tools Used

- PySpark
- SparkSQL
- Google Colab

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the utilization of SparkSQL for analyzing home sales data and deriving meaningful insights. By leveraging PySpark functions and optimizing queries through data caching and partitioning, users can efficiently process and analyze large-scale datasets.
